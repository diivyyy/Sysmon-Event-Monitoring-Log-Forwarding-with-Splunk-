# Sysmon-Event-Monitoring-Log-Forwarding-with-Splunk-
This project demonstrates configuring Sysmon on Windows 10 for event monitoring and forwarding logs to Splunk Enterprise on Kali Linux via Universal Forwarder. Logs are stored in the win10 index, and alerts for authentication failures are set up. The setup enhances security monitoring by detecting suspicious activities in real time.
